        <h2 class="main">Introduction to Servlets Quiz</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>1. What is the difference between a web server and a web container?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Web Container or Servlet Container or Servlet Engine : is used to manage the components like servlets, JSP. It is a part of the web server. It is web based, runtime environment to support J2EE components. Just as a "servlet container" (such as provided as Tomcat) is a runtime environment for java servlets. <br>
	Web Server or HTTP Server: a server which is capable of handling HTTP request send by a client and respond back with a HTTP response. Web server only serves static web pages. Apache, Apache/Tomcat, ISS and JBoss/Tomcat are all examples of web servers. <br>
	Having web container implies having a web server. But a web server need not have anything to do with containers.</dd>
        
        <dt><strong>2. What is a servlet?</strong></dt>
	<dd>A servlet is a Java class that extends the capabilities of servers that host applications access by means of a request-response programming model.</dd>
        
            <dt><strong>3. How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Web servers interact with servlets with the help of containers. Containers manage the communication between the web servers and servlets. When web servers request for a servlet . Then containers search for servlets based on the URLs. It interacts with servlets with following steps:
				<ul>
					<li>Container Creates and initialize the servlets.</li>
					<li>Containers invokes the service method of the servlets based on the method specified GET or POST.</li>
					<li>Servlets compute the request object and returns dynamic HTML page stuffed in the response object and send it to the containers.</li>
					<li>Finally containers send the dynamic HTML page to the web servers.</li>
				</ul>
			</dd>
                      <dt><strong>4. Who creates request objects?</strong></dt>
                        <dd>Containers create the request objects.</dd>
                        <dt><strong>5. What are the steps in the servlet life cycle?</strong></dt>
			<dd>he steps in servlet life cycle are as follows:-
				<ul>
                                   <li>Load servlet class (Class c = Class.forname(...))</li>
                                    <li>Instantiate servlet (c.newInstance());</li>
                                 <li> init() called only once in the servlet's life. Must complete before Container can call service().</li>
                           <li>service() (called for each request, each request runs in a separate thread)</li>
                        <li>destroy() (called only once)</li>
			</ul>
			</dd>
                        <dt><strong>6. Who call init and when?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Container call init when the servlet is initialised.</dd>
                        <dt><strong>7. Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?</strong></dt>
			<dd>We need to override doGet method in the servlet class.</dd>
                        <dt><strong>8. In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Container automatically creates a new java thread for every servlet request instead of running it in different process. Service method of servlet can be called multiples times each call is run in different thread.</dd>
                        <dt><strong>9.What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables?</strong> </dt>
			<dd>Servlet instance variables are not thread safe as the container does not create a new instance of the Servlet class for each request. It reuses an existing one.</dd>
