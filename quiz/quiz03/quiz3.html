<h3>1- What is the main value of Java Server Pages?</h3>
<p>The main page is written in regular HTML, while special tags are provided to insert pieces of Java programming codes. The business programming logic and the presentation are cleanly separated. This allows the programmers to focus on the business logic, while the web designer to concentrate on the presentation.</p>
<h3>2- How are JSP pages related to servlets?</h3>
<p>JSP pages are finally converted to Servlets so it is obvious that it is related to the servlet. When the JSP page is first requested, the JSP server compiles the class generated by the JSP engine to a servlet.</p>
<h3>3- How are JSP pages related to HTML?</h3>
<p>JSP pages are a combination of the HTML code and the Java code. JSP runs on the server whereas HTML runs on the browser.</p>
<h3>4. Give an example of a JSP scriptlet and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.</h3>
<p>Scriptlets are nothing but java code enclosed within &lt;% and %&gt; tags. JSP container moves the statements enclosed in it to _jspService() method while generating servlet from JSP. The use of scriplets in JSP is for Java statements: &lt;% java statements %&gt; e.g. &lt;% count++; %&gt;</p>
<h3>5- Give an example of a JSP declaration and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.</h3>
<p>JSP declaration are used to declare the instance variable and/or methods inside JSP. The use of declaration in JSP &lt;%! java declaration statements %&gt; e.g. &lt;%! int count = 0; %&gt;</p>
<h3>6- Give an example of a JSP comment and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.</h3>
<p> The comments  in the JSP codes is likewise: &lt;%-- That&#39s a jsp comments --%&gt;</p>
<h3>7- Give an example of a JSP expression and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.</h3>
<p>JSP Expression are used to insert Java expression inside JSP. Expects a Java expression and put it inside out.println() in service method. The use is as follows: &lt;%= java expression %&gt; e.g. &lt;%= ++count %&gt; which is equivalent to out.println(++count);</p>
<h3>8- Give an example of a JSP directive and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.</h3>
<p>JSP directives control the processing of an entire JSP page. It gives directions to the server regarding processing of a page. The use is as follows: &lt;%@ .... %&gt;</p>
<h3>9- Explain how an EL expression is evaluated.</h3>
<p>An EL expression is a compact expression of systematic evaluation of the page, request, session and application scopes. Also if EL cannot find a value for the attribute it ignore it and results null i.e. EL is "null friendly".</p>
<h3>10- Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions.</h3>
<p>The servlet attribute are involved in EL expression as follows: EL uses by default PageContext#findAttribute() which scans in subsequently the page, request, session and application scopes for the firstnext non-null attribute value matching the given attribute name. We can explicitly specify the different scopes as ${pageScode}, ${requestScope}, ${sessionScope} or ${applicationScope}.</p>
<h3>11- Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact.</h3>
<p>When this statement is encountered during page execution, the page buffer is output to the browser and the servlet is executed. When the servlet has finished executing, control is transferred back to the JSP page and the page continues executing. This is the same functionality as for jsp:include actions from one JSP page to another.</p>
